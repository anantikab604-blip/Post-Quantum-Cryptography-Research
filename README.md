# Post-Quantum-Cryptography-Research
Research and simulation project on post-quantum cryptography including Shor’s algorithm and PQC readiness analysis


# Post-Quantum Cryptography Research

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the study of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), including:

- Simulation of Shor’s Algorithm
- Analysis of vulnerabilities in RSA and ECC
- Study of NIST PQC standardization
- Industry readiness (Thales PQC Readiness)
